# qualitative variable
# - can not be ordered in a logical or natural way (colour of the eye, gender)
# - can assign number instead of text (gender 1- male 2 - female)

# quantitative variable
# - measurable values can be ordered in logical and natural way (size of shoes)

# discrete variable 
# - can have finite number 
# - qualitative and quantitative variables can be discrete

# continuous variable
# - infinite number of values

# scale
# different variables contain different amounts of info

# nominal scale
# can not be ordered

# ordinal scale 
# can be ordered
# differences between values can not be interpreted/compared in a numerical way 
# example: values of education level (primary, secondary, university)

# continuous scale
# can be ordered
# differences between values can be interpreted/compared in a numerical way
# example: height of a person

# others are interval scale, ration scale, absolute scale

# grouped variables - if data is grouped [0 - 20], (20. 30]
# categorical variables - any variable which takes finite small number of values
# binary variable - can take two values

# data set
# data is in data matrix/set 
# row is observation 
# column is variable
# can have missing values or you miggt need to do transformations (km to miles)
